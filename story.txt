The huge L.A. fire that engulfed an apartment tower over an area the size of a city block is being treated as a criminal fire.
Although blazes "of this magnitude" are always treated as criminal fires, "it's very rare for the entire building to be engulfed at once," Capt. Jaime Moore told the Los Angeles Times.
"There may have been some foul play."
Arson investigators are going to examine the building and financial records. Dogs trained to sniff out accelerants were also at the scene.
Flames could be seen for miles from the fire that broke out in the DaVinci apartment complex about 1:20 a.m. The fire closed freeways and roads, burst windows of nearby buildings and melted freeway signs.
"It looked like a bomb had just exploded," said L.A. fire Capt. Rick Godinez.
